Traditional ***Snake*** game in C++ for Windows console with multiplayer feature.

1. Single Player
2. Hot Seat Player - up to 4 player at one keyboard
3. Network Multiplayer  - udp internet communication up to 2 players

Welcome:
In an effort to get some warm up practice in I decided to create my own Snake game example, which can be played within the Windows console.
The Snake game is rendered using only ASCII characters.

This game is not perfect. But It works!

***Network MultiPlayer***
For UDP Client/Server connection is used eNet library from: http://enet.bespin.org/. The C++ wrapper I written is here: https://github.com/tomasmark79/server-client.
The code its not perfect, but for only the excersice enough.

To start game you have to enter bind IP address for server and remote IP address for client and you are ready to multi play over internet network with your colleague.
